## Tasks: ##

# 1. Function: add_numbers

Write a Python function named add_numbers that takes two parameters num1 and num2, and returns the sum of the two numbers.

# 2. Function: is_even

Write a Python function named is_even that takes a single parameter number and returns True if the number is even, and False otherwise.

# 3. Function: reverse_string

Write a Python function named reverse_string that takes a string text as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

# 4. Function: count_vowels

Write a Python function named count_vowels that takes a string text as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.

# 5. Function: calculate_factorial

Write a Python function named calculate_factorial that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

# 6. Function: apply_decorator

Write a Python function named apply_decorator that takes a function func as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

# 7. Sequences: Sort List of Tuples

Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and an age, write a Python function named sort_by_age that sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order.

# 8. Sets and Dictionaries: Merge Dictionaries

Write a Python function named merge_dicts that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys, their values should be summed up.

# 9. Object-Oriented Programming: Class Creation

Define a Python class named Car with the following attributes: make, model, year. Implement a method named display_info that prints out the car's information.
